# Resume

## How it works

On top of the basic palette of HTML, Javascript, and CSS, I brought in a few libraries, JQuery, Bootstrap, Underscore, and RequireJS.

* _Bootstrap_ - easy, responsive design 
* _JQuery_ - easy, functional code
* _Underscore_ - templates to reduce hardcoded content
* _RequireJS_ - AMD pattern javascript (I know it's not necessary for a project of this small a scale, but I thought I'd try it out)

## Inspiration

The Rubik's Cube in the navigation bar was actually what this all was originally about.
I was just thinking it'd be cool to have a Rubik's Cube spin around as you scroll.
That idea coincided with my idea to build an online portfolio or resume.
So, I just merged the two ideas and went with it. Why not?
